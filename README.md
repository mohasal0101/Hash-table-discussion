-   [Hash Table](https://www.programiz.com/dsa/hash-table)
*a **hash table**, also known as **hash map**, is a [data structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_structure "Data structure") that implements an [associative array](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associative_array "Associative array") or dictionary. It is an [abstract data type](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_data_type "Abstract data type") that maps [keys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unique_key "Unique key") to [values](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(computer_science) "Value (computer science)").[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_table#cite_note-ms-2) A hash table uses a [hash function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_function "Hash function") to compute an _index_, also called a _hash code_, into an array of _buckets_ or _slots_, from which the desired value can be found. During lookup, the key is hashed and the resulting hash indicates where the corresponding value is stored.*

	*Hash Table is  **a data structure which stores data in an associative manner**. In a hash table, data is stored in an array format, where each data value has its own unique index value. Access of data becomes very fast if we know the index of the desired data.*

	### Why is it called hash table?
	*hash tables are called that way  **because of using hash code and it's related to "cut food"**. Think of it like this - you take your nice pretty object, like a fruit, then hash it so that it starts looking just like anything else - just a number - there's no more structure in it anymore.*

-   [JavaScript Hash Tables](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/javascript/hashtables)

***JavaScript already has two Hash Table implementations**, writing your own Hash Table implementation is one of the most common JavaScript interview questions. You can implement a Hash Table in JavaScript in three steps: Create a HashTable class with table and size initial properties*


*In computer programming, the data structure is used to store, organise, and utilise the data.  **Javascript hash() function converts the input strings into fixed-sized data (numbers) and returns the hash value**.*

*In JavaScript, a “hash table” is a data structure that can be utilized to map keys to their specified values. It is also known as a “hash map“. Hash tables  **efficiently perform the insertion and deletion operation for a key-value pair and search the value of a key within a hash table**.*
